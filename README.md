This repository contains the analysis code for the manuscript "Motivations for cannabis and alcohol use in adolescents prone to psychosis".

1. GLM_models_logistic_regressions.R

This R code contains code to conduct the logistic regressions with cross-sectional data from the last assessment from the main sample of the study (Co-Venture sample). This code is used to answer aim 1 of the study.

2. LME_models.R

This R code contains code for all linear mixed effects (LME) models conducted as part of aim 2 and 3 of the study. LME models utilized the 5 repeated measures (assessments) to examine the relationships between year-to-year change in motives to use and four different mental health outcomes (continuous psychosis risk, internalizing and externalizing symptoms, and substance use problems). 

3. GLMM_model.R

This R code contains code for the generalized linear mixed effects models (GLMM) conducted to evaluate the longitudinal association between motives to use and psychosis risk while controlling for the longitudinal association between motives to use and other mental health outcomes (internalizing and externalizing symptoms, and substance use problems).
